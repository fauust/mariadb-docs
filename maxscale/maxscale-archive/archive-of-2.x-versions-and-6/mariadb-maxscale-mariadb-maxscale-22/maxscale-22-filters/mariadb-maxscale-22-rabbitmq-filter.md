# RabbitMQ Filter

### Overview

This filter is designed to extract queries and transform them into a canonical\
form e.g. `INSERT INTO database.table VALUES ("John Doe", "Downtown",100,50.0);`\
turns into `INSERT INTO database.table VALUES ("?", "?",?,?);`. The filter\
pushes these canonized queries and their replies into a RabbitMQ broker where\
they can later be retrieved from. The retrieval can be done with a custom\
application or the [RabbitMQ Consumer Client](mariadb-maxscale-22-rabbitmq-consumer-client.md)\
utility tool, which reads the messages from the broker and sends the contents of\
those messages as SQL queries to a database.

### Configuration

The configuration block for the **mqfilter** requires the minimal filter options\
in its section within the MaxScale configuration file. Although the filter will\
start, it will use the default values which only work with a freshly installed\
RabbitMQ server and use its default values. This setup is mostly intended for\
testing the filter.

The following is an example of an mqfilter configuration used for actual logging\
of queries to a RabbitMQ broker on a different host.

```
[RabbitMQ]
type=filter
module=mqfilter
hostname=192.168.122.100
port=4000
username=messageuser
password=msgpwd
exchange=msg-ex-1
key=MaxScale
logging_trigger=object,schema,source
logging_strict=false
logging_log_all=false
logging_object=my1
logging_schema=test
logging_source_user=maxtest

[RabbitMQ Service]
type=service
router=readconnrouter
servers=server1
user=myuser
passwd=mypasswd
filters=RabbitMQ
```

#### Filter Options

The mqfilter filter does not support any filter options.

#### Filter Parameters

The RabbitMQ filter has parameters to control which queries are logged based on\
either the attributes of the user or the query itself. These can be combined to\
to only log queries targeting a certain table in a certain database from a\
certain user from a certain network address.
